# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard

# Overview
This project aims to analyze road accident data using PowerBI, providing insights into various factors contributing to accidents such as time of day, weather conditions, road types, and more. The analysis helps stakeholders understand patterns and trends to make informed decisions for road safety measures and traffic management.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, containing detailed information about road accidents including location, date and time, severity, weather conditions, road type, vehicle types involved, and casualties.

# Objectives
1) Identify trends and patterns in road accidents over time.
2) Analyze the correlation between different factors and accident severity.
3) Visualize accident hotspots and identify areas requiring attention.

# Key Features
### Interactive Dashboard:
Explore accident data through interactive dashboard, enabling users to filter and drill down into specific parameters.
### Time Analysis:
Understand how accident rates vary by time of day, day of the week, and month of the year.
### Geospatial Visualization:
Visualize accident locations on a map to identify high-risk zones and patterns across regions.
### Severity Analysis:
Analyze the severity of accidents based on various factors such as weather conditions, road type, and vehicle involvement.
### Trend Analysis:
Track accident trends over time and compare year-on-year or month-on-month changes.

# Technologies Used
1) PowerBI: For data visualization, dashboard creation, and interactive analysis.
2) Excel: For data preprocessing and cleaning.
3) GitHub: For version control and collaboration among team members.

# Usage
Users can interact with the dashboards to gain insights into road accident data and make data-driven decisions to improve road safety measures.
